    <h2>Steps to cook the fried rice</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Break up large clumps of rice and separate the grains with wet fingers.</li>
        <li>Preheat a 14-inch wok or 12-inch skillet over high heat for about 1 minute. Swirl in the oil and heat until it becomes runny and starts to shimmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add garlic and onion and stir until fragrant, about 15 to 30 seconds. Add the carrots and cook until tender, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Move all the ingredients to one side of the wok. Break the eggs into the wok, and stir to scramble until they are almost cooked through but still a little soggy, about 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and the peas, followed by the rice, stirring and tossing between each addition. Use your spatula to break up any clumps.</li>
        <li>Add the sauces, and salt and white pepper to taste. Stir everything swiftly around the wok until the rice is well-coated and -colored (little bits of white here and there is OK) and heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add more oil if the rice begins to stick to the wok; reduce the heat if it starts to scorch. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.</li>
        <li>Divide the rice among dinner plates. Serve immediately.</li>
